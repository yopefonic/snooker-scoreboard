# Problem statement

When your playing a game of snooker you will almost always want to keep the score one way or the other. If you do it more often than just once you might want to see what the highest break is and what the average. If you playing multiple frames against an opponent you might also want to keep that score.

Normally there is a scoreboard somewhere near where you are playing. but keeping highest breaks, averages and frames is almost always a bit of a hassle. This web-app should allow you to keep score with a lot more detail.
